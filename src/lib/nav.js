// src/lib/nav.js
// SENTINEL: NB_PULSE_NAV_V1
//
// ONE nav model. The sidebar and the bottom bar both read this file, and that
// is the entire reason it exists.
//
// ── THE TWO BUGS THIS FIXES, BOTH REAL, BOTH SHIPPED ────────────────────────
//
//   1. MESSAGES WAS UNREACHABLE ON A PHONE. The sidebar listed it. The bottom
//      bar's four primary tabs did not, and neither did the More sheet. A whole
//      feature existed on desktop and did not exist on mobile, because the two
//      lists were typed out separately and drifted.
//
//   2. THE PROJECTS TAB WENT NOWHERE. /projects/ redirects to /clients/ in
//      App.jsx, so the fourth tab on every phone navigated somewhere with a
//      different name and then failed to highlight, because isActive checked a
//      path the router had already thrown away.
//
// Neither was a hard failure. Both were invisible to anybody testing on a
// laptop, which is how they lasted.
//
// ── HOW TO ADD A PAGE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Add it to NAV once. It appears in the sidebar automatically. If it belongs on
// a phone's primary bar, move it above the MOBILE_PRIMARY_COUNT line. Everything
// below that line lands in the More sheet. There is nowhere else to edit.
//
// No oxford commas, no em dashes.
